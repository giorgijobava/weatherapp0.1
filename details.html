        <h1>How the Weather App Works</h1>
        
        <section>
            <h2>1. User Interface</h2>
            <p>The app has a simple and clean interface where users can input the name of a city to get its weather information or use their current location. There are buttons for searching by city name and for using the current location.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>2. City Input</h2>
            <p>Users can type the name of any city in the input box and press the search button to get the weather for that city. The app will fetch the weather data from a weather API.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Current Weather</h2>
            <p>After entering a city name or using the current location, the app displays current weather data such as temperature, weather conditions, and an icon representing the weather. It also shows additional details like the date and location of the weather data.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>4. 5-Day Forecast</h2>
            <p>The app also displays a 5-day weather forecast, showing the temperature and weather conditions for each of the next 5 days. Each forecast includes an icon and temperature information for each day.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>5. Todayâ€™s Highlights</h2>
            <p>This section shows important data such as air quality, humidity, pressure, visibility, wind speed, and "feels like" temperature. Each of these metrics is presented in a card with a simple icon to indicate what it represents.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Sunrise and Sunset</h2>
            <p>The app provides the times for sunrise and sunset for the selected location, helping users understand the length of daylight for that day.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>7. Hourly Forecast</h2>
            <p>Hourly forecast shows the weather for every 3 hours of the day, displaying the temperature and weather icon for each hour.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>8. Switch Mode</h2>
            <p>There is a button at the top to switch between light and dark modes, which changes the app's appearance for better visibility based on your preference.</p>
